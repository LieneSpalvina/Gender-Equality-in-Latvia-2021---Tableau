6 Phases Of Data Analysis

1. ASK

"The first phase of the data analysis process is asking the right questions. You should clearly understand why you are doing this analysis and what kind of problem you are solving." 

As gender equality is still a big problem in Latvia, I chose to analyze it and share my findings. 

2.PREPARE

"Preparing your data means collecting or using the data relevant to the problem you are trying to solve."

As I only chose to analyze gender equality in Latvia, I found public datasets in Latvia's statistical database, and as Latvia is part of the EU. EU has the organization "European Institute for Gender Equality" who collects, analyzes and spreads data on the equality between women and men.

3.PROCESS

"Data processing is to find various inaccuracies, errors, inconsistencies in the data and get rid of them so that our primary business problem is not affected. You have to clean the data so that the data is consistent and will not affect the credibility of the analysis."

For the data process step, I used Exel as I had small datasets. I renamed the headers and checked if the structure of the dataset was structured in a way that I can analyze it even better.

4.ANALYZE

"The primary goal in this phase is to find the relationships, trends, and patterns that will help you solve your business problem more accurately. In this phase, you will think analytically about the data."

My task was to understand which data from the datasets I particularly need. What calculations do I need to create in order to understand the problem better? This step helped me to understand how the data is related and how it affects gender equality altogether. 

5. SHARE

"The fifth phase is to share your data findings. You can do this with the help of visualization because putting information in the image can help people understand the analysis easily. You will think of the various graphs and plots to convey your findings more quickly."

For the share step, I used Tableau where I created various graphs for the datasets. I used various graphs because each graph visualizes the data differently and more understandable to users. 

6.ACT

"The sixth phase of the data is to act. In this phase, we will use everything we have learned from our analysis and act upon it.."

I published my dashboard on Linkedin and Tableau public. I wrote a small summary about my findings.
